{"google":"","body":"# TIME MANAGEMENT AT IISER MOHALI\r\n\r\nPeople around us live in a world where they get only 24 hours a day. Since we share the same world with them, it is safe to assume that we also have 24 hours in a day.\r\n\r\nAccording to the guidelines available, an average human needs 8 hours a day worth of sleep. This means we only have 16 hours a day to do all the work expected from us.\r\n\r\nA normal person would like to bathe, crap, wash his/her face, brush his/her teeth, etc every day. Lets assume this normal person can somehow do all this in just 1 hour a day (a tough job, given that half the times either there is no warm water (in winters) or no water at all (all year round). This leaves him with 15 hours a day for doing the rest of the work.\r\n\r\nNow, as our biology would have it, we also need to eat 3 times a day. Given the way the mess at IISER work, it takes us about an hour a meal (most of this time is spent in the line). And with this we are down to 12 hours for doing all our work. In this we are supposed to study, entertain ourselves, socialize, etc. This is a total of 84 hours in a week.\r\n\r\nOut of this, on an average, an IISER student will spend between 1 - 2 hours a day (for 5 days) loitering around waiting for the next class. That gives us 76 (I knocked off only 8 hours per week on loitering. I know this is debatable, especially given that we have to spend time in bus to get to the labs that are not there in IISER, like the workshop and nuclear physics lab etc.) hours for study, personality development and for recreation.\r\n\r\nLets see what IISER wants us to do in these 76 hours. Our course book says that we are to study for 54 (for 1 semester), 57(for 2 semesters), 60(for 4 semesters), 63(for 2 semesters), 75(for 1 semester) hours a week. Lets take the average of 60 hours a week for study. Look, we have 16 hours a week for our hobbies, recreations and personality development. This translates to about 2 hours and 15 minutes per day. This is the amount of time you have per day to talk to your friends, watch an occasional movie, enjoy your club activities, workout at the gym, etc.\r\n\r\nMost people would be happy with this in normal condition, except things are not so normal in this place. If you want to do some recreation, there is just nothing here. If you want to take care of your body by going to the gym, I dare you to try that in the dump-room that it is now, with all machines broken and study tables filling the rest of the space. If you want to play a game of basketball, play on the court that has been broken for almost as long as it has existed. You want to go out and enjoy a meal, go but please dont enjoy because you have to rush back to the hostel by 10 and it takes atleast half an hour to go to the nearest decent eat-out so you are anyways wasting half your free time on travelling. I guess you have to opt for another option: virtual fun. Try going online and having some fun or catching up with friends. Most people will spend all their free time trying to find a place where there is signal for the wifi to connect or once it's connected, they'll be wondering what proxy, ip setting combination will work. Best of luck for your recreation. You'll spend all your time doing this unless you have wasted hundreds of hours and now are just about getting a hang of it.\r\n\r\nI dont want to sound as a cry baby complaining for things but I wanted a means of recreation so I did this. But now that I have done this, I realize IISER doesn't even like this. They wont let our magazine print a beautiful version in color and will delay the print by months (more than half a year) and by then I'll be wondering what is it that IISER wants us to become? Does it want us to be sientists with open mind or does it want us to constrain us so much that we break and science becomes a demon for us and thinking an alien activity. Just something to ponder over.\r\n\r\n# Scholarships At IISER\r\n\r\nIISER offers you a scholarship of Rs 5000 per month. Wow!! They now own you. Guess what are the most common statements I have heard from IISER admin. \"You are paid to do this.\" and \"We will cut your scholarship.\". Lets look at these scholarships closely.\r\n\r\nWe get Rs. 5000 per month over a average 30.5 days a month. This corresponds to Rs. 164 per day. Congratulations you are being paid Rs 49 per day more than the minimum wage guidelines (Rs. 115 per day). They really do own you!! But wait... There is a catch. Lets look at the law closely this time. It says for 9 hours of work a day (which includes a half an hour break for every 5 hours of work), Rs. 115 is the wage. Lets convert this to the real situation this time. IISER expects us to work for 10 hours a day (which entitles us to 1 hour break). This means they must pay us for 11 hours a day. This means they must pay us Rs. 140.5 per day. A total of Rs. 4287 a month. Congrats!! They are paying you an extra Rs. 713 per month.\r\n\r\nOh Did I forget that they also ask us to pay for getting this job!! That takes the edge away I am sure!!","tagline":"A few things I realized about IISER Mohali","note":"Don't delete this file!
